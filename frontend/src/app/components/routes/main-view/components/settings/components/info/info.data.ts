        question: "What is CMS?",
        answer: `CMS is an acronym for Club Management System - comprehensive system used by sport clubs to efficiently

            processes, enhance team potential, automate various club-related tasks, and facilitate the smooth flow of
            information within the organization. In essence, a Club Management System serves as a centralized platform
            that empowers clubs to optimize their activities, improve their overall performance, and provide a seamless
            means of communication and information sharing among members and stakeholders.`,
